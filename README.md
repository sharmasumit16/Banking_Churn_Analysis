## Structure Of The Project

- Collected data from the RBC bank Website
- Removed Null values and also cleaned some data in power query
- Modeled the data with Star Schema
- Prepared attractive dashboard using bar graph,pie charts, tables,buttons etc.

## The feature taken into consideration for classification of players performance:-

-  **RowNumber**—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
-  **CustomerId**—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
-  **Surname**—the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
-  **CreditScore**—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank
-  **Geography**—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
-  **Gender**—it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
-  **Age**—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
-  **Tenure**—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to                              leave  a bank.
-  **Balance**—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared                        to those with lower balances.
-  **NumOfProducts**—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank. 
-  **HasCrCard**—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to 
                         leave the bank.
	           -      1 represents credit card holder
	           -      0 represents non credit card holder
-  **IsActiveMember**—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
	           -      1 represents Active Member
	           -      0 represents Inactive Member
-  **Estimated Salary**—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
-  **Exited**—whether or not the customer left the bank.
                      -      0 represents Retain 
                      -      1 represents Exit
-  **Bank DOJ** — date when the Customer associated/joined  with the bank.
